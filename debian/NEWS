systemtap (0.0.20070825-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of systemtap does not use sudo to run /usr/bin/staprun binary.
  Instead, staprun is installed suid-root. To be able to run systemtap scripts
  you must be in group 'stapdev'. It is also possible to run some precompiled
  scripts for users in group 'stapusr'. As usual, root can run any scripts.
  See /usr/share/doc/systemtap/README.security for details on new security
  model.
